Choices can be efficiently represented in Django: you can use a small CharField of keys stored in the database, associated with verboses descriptions, which can even be translated.

Here is the example from [the official doc](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/fields/#choices):

```python
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
    FRESHMAN = 'FR'
    SOPHOMORE = 'SO'
    JUNIOR = 'JR'
    SENIOR = 'SR'
    YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES = (
        (FRESHMAN, 'Freshman'),
        (SOPHOMORE, 'Sophomore'),
        (JUNIOR, 'Junior'),
        (SENIOR, 'Senior'),
    )
    year_in_school = models.CharField(max_length=2,
                                      choices=YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES,
                                      default=FRESHMAN)

    def is_upperclass(self):
        return self.year_in_school in (self.JUNIOR, self.SENIOR)
```

`year_in_school` is then really convinient to use, because you get the HTML's `<select>` that exactly fits your needs, and Django also generates for you a [`get_year_in_school_display()`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/instances/#django.db.models.Model.get_FOO_display) method that outputs the verbose version you are looking for.

But, hey, who wants to write all of those constants ?
Here is my version for the same functionnalities, you'll quickly understand my point:

```python
from django.db import models
from enum import IntEnum

def enum_to_choices(enum):
    return ((item.value, item.name) for item in list(enum))

class Student(models.Model):
    YEARS_IN_SCHOOL = IntEnum('years_in_school', 'freshman sophomore junior senior')
    year_in_school = models.IntegerField(choices=enum_to_choices(YEARS_IN_SCHOOL),
                                         default=1)

    def is_upperclass(self):
        return self.year_in_chool >= YEARS_IN_SCHOOL.junior
```

I think that years in school may benefits of beeing represented with numbers, but in other use cases, you can also use `models.CharField` and `Enum`
