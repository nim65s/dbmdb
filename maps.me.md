Here is a [little script](https://github.com/nim65s/scripts/blob/master/google_to_maps.me.py) to transfer the location
you saved into google maps from [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) directly into
[maps.me](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro).

Once you have the `generated.kml` file, just open it from your phone, and maps.me will show you those locations.
